step-by-step instructions to install and optimize Windows 10 or 11

## Introduction
I have installed, reinstalled, repaired, and modified Windows numerous times on my own machines, as well as those of friends and family. I believe this process results in one of the most clean, frustration-free Windows experiences out there, while making as little sacrifices as possible.
## Notes
- A majority of this process involves removing/disabling aspects of Windows, so I recommend installing Windows LTSC, which comes with as little preinstalled apps as possible, security updates only, and access to the Group Policy Editor (basically Registry Editor on steroids). You can learn more about Windows LTSC [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/ltsc/overview).
- Switching between versions or upgrading versions of Windows could keep your computer in the same bloated state it started in, so I highly encourage a fresh installation. Your system disk will be wiped during this process, so take some time to think about files you want to keep and are unrecoverable (not stored in the cloud). It might surprise you how little there is to save. Some examples are browser bookmarks (if not synced), videos, photos, homework, and Minecraft worlds. Move these somewhere that is not your system disk, such as a secondary hard drive or flash drive before starting.
- Windows LTSC has two main versions: IOT and non-IOT. The main difference is that IOT has 10 years of support while non-IOT has 5. I recommend the IOT version. 
## Steps
1. Download a Windows LTSC iso of your choosing [here](https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links) and verify it is genuine using [Windows and Office Genuine ISO Verifier](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/windows_and_office_genuine_iso_verifier.html).
   - Optional: Debloat the iso with the microwin tool within [winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).
2. Burn the iso to a flash drive with either [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html). With how large even the cheapest flash drives are today, it would be a waste to burn a single 5gb iso to it. Therefore, I recommend using Ventoy as it allows you to hold multiple bootable iso's as well as regular files within the same flash drive.
3. To avoid complications upon the rare occurence that the drivers included with Windows don't have a compatible driver for your ethernet port or WiFi card, visit your machine or motherboard manufacturers website and download the corresponding drivers. Then store them on the flash drive runing Ventoy. Do the same with [O&O ShutUp](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10).
4. If applicable, unplug your ethernet cable before continuing. This will prevent Windows from automoatically installing drivers after the installation completes. 
5. Change the first boot option in your machine's BIOS to the flash drive with the windows ISO and go through the installation process. Make sure you know which drive is the designated system drive beforehand, as it is not always Drive 0 and delete all partitions on the drive. 
6. When the installation process prompts you for a network, select "I don't have internet". Switch every option to "no" under **Choose privacy settings for your device**. Do not log into a Microsoft account unless absolutely necessary.
7. Once you reach the desktop, search for "Group Policy Editor" and open it. Open the folder **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds** and select the **Allow Telemetry** setting. Change the state to **Enabled** and under options select **0 - Security [Enterprise Only]**. Next, open the folder **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update** and change the state of **Do not include drivers with Windows Updates** to **Enabled**. Finally, run O&O ShutUp on the Ventoy flash drive and select **Actions > Apply only recommended settings**. If you choose either of the other two options, remember to reenable app access to the microphone and camera if you wish to use apps like Discord. Reboot the computer when finished and connect to the internet.
9. If an ethernet cable is plugged in and your computer is still not connecting to the internet, run the network driver installers on the Ventoy flash drive. Now, it's time to activate Windows. If you have already activated Windows LTSC permanently on the machine before, you can skip the rest of this step. To do this, follow the instructions for using [MAS](https://massgrave.dev/). 
10. Your screen has probably looked slightly wonky this entire time, so install display drivers from your manufacturers website. If your machine has a Nvidia GPU, I recommend using [NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/) to install drivers. If you are running a laptop with integrated and discrete graphics, install drivers from both manufacturers if applicable.
